Embarrassingly, despite being subscribed to hundreds of [RSS] feeds personally, this site has never published one. Until now!

-----

There were three tasks:

1. Generate the feed ([commit][c1])
   
   11ty provides an easy-to-use [RSS plugin] that does the bulk of the work for me. I only had to decide which content to include: all of [/writing/]. I made one additional update: I created a new collection from which to generate the feed that is limited to the most recent 20 items in /writing/. I've heard stories about people with large static sites having their build times slow to a crawl because their feed generation was crawling hundreds of posts and creating an enormous file. RSS readers generally limit a feed to the most recent 10 posts or those published in the last 30 days. A limit of 20 should be well within those boundaries for the way I plan to use this site.

1. Add a page layout ([commit][c2])

   In a misguided attempt at content portability, I had included each post's title in the post content itself, which resulted in the title being displayed twice in a feed reader. For now, the page layout merely extends the base layout and displays the page's title, but I can imagine many more eventual features, mostly regarding the display of metadata.

1. Add `link` tags to the `head`, for auto-discovery ([commit][c3])

   Following the [guidance of the WHATWG], I added the appropriate `link`s to the site's `head`, in the base layout. This will help browsers, feed readers, and other services discover my feed.

After publishing those updates, I searched for the site's name in [Feedly] (my current feed reader) and subscribed. Seeing something I made displayed in a tool I've used every day for over a decade brought a big smile to my face.
